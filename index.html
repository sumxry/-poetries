        <p>Love killed poets,<br>May love also kill me.<br><br>With every word, I bleed inside,<br>A shattered soul, no place to hide.<br><br>My heart was open, pure, and true,<br>But love tore it, piece by piece, through.<br>They said it would heal,<br>But all it did was steal.<br><br>I write these lines with trembling hands,<br>For I know this is where it ends,<br>Love took my breath, my mind, my soul,<br>Leaving me empty, no longer whole.<br><br>Love killed poets,<br>And it will kill me too,<br>For when love dies,<br>There’s nothing left to do.<br><br>~summry</p>

        <h2>Her</h2>
        <p>And then… she came, so gentle, so kind,<br>A girl who healed the cracks in my mind.<br>She was a little shorter, with specs on her face,<br>Big, beautiful eyes filled with grace.<br>Her pink lips spoke words like a song,<br>And her cold, delicate hands held me strong.<br>Her short hair danced with every move,<br>She was the one thing I didn’t want to lose.<br><br>For the first time, I felt alive,<br>In her presence, I learned to survive.<br>She never loved me, yet I loved her still,<br>She became my light, my broken heart’s will.<br><br>~summry</p>

        <h2>Fading Away</h2>
        <p>I used school as a distraction,<br>But it didn’t ease the attraction,<br>Of my mind that’s stuck in place,<br>A heart lost in empty space.<br><br>I played songs to numb the pain,<br>But they only stir the rain,<br>The beats don’t heal, they just confuse,<br>Another way to feel abused.<br><br>I wrote poems from deep inside,<br>But now the words just run and hide,<br>The paper’s blank, no voice to hear,<br>Just silence ringing loud and clear.<br><br>I sit in the dark, hoping for light,<br>But it’s just me and my endless fight,<br>Chasing dreams that slip away,<br>And waiting for tomorrow, another day.<br><br>~summry</p>

        <p>Love is the fire that lights the dark,<br>A spark in the soul, a burning mark.<br>It whispers softly, it shouts aloud,<br>A heart beats louder, lost in the crowd.<br><br>In your eyes, I see the stars,<br>In your touch, I’ve traveled far.<br>Every kiss, a sweet refrain,<br>A melody that soothes my pain.<br><br>Love, it’s wild, it’s free, it’s true,<br>Forever lost in me and you.<br><br>~summry</p>

        <h2>Terror of Silence</h2>
        <p>The shadows crawl, the walls they speak,<br>Whispers from places where light won’t peek.<br>Eyes that follow, never seen,<br>Hands that touch, cold and keen.<br><br>Footsteps echo in the dead of night,<br>But no one’s there, just endless fright.<br>The air grows thick, the room feels tight,<br>As something stirs just out of sight.<br><br>A scream that chokes, a door that’s locked,<br>The terror’s real, but time’s been mocked.<br>In the silence, it waits, it hides,<br>A nightmare where no one survives.<br><br>~summry</p>

        <p>She’s standing in the green with golden dupatta on her right<br>Face tilted down with eyes big and bright,<br><br>Yellow golden flowers are also in the frame<br>But everything fades that comes against her name,<br><br>Looking like an angel calm and sincere<br>Seeing her without glasses is lovely and rare.<br><br>~summry</p>

        <p>I am Summry, a soul lost in the dark,<br>A fragile boy, carrying endless scars.<br>Born into a house where love was a lie,<br>Where screams echoed, and hope would die.<br><br>I watched my mother, her tears never dry,<br>As my father’s rage tore her sky.<br>Each day he broke her with words and fists,<br>And I, too small, could only exist.<br><br>I prayed for it to stop, for it to end,<br>But prayers, it seems, aren’t meant to mend.<br>For years I sat in silent and death was near,<br>Looking for someone, to care.<br><br>Then there was Naman, my only friend,<br>The one who promised he’d never bend.<br>He saw me when no one else could,<br>He stayed by my side when no one would.<br><br>And then… she came, so gentle, so kind,<br>A girl who healed the cracks in my mind.<br>She was a little shorter, with specs on her face,<br>Big, beautiful eyes filled with grace.<br>~summry</p>
